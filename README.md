This is my first big project. I created an online store. I didn't add the pictures to the actual code here because I wasn't sure about copywrights for the pictures I used in my project. This was just something I wanted to do
on my own. I learned alot from this. I also created the APIs that it uses with C#. This was on a DB that I have on a VM on my laptop. 
In the Pictures folder you can see the program and how it looks. I have a couple of different setups when displaying the merchandise. 

The account only shows up once someone has been logged in and is in a protected route. The account page will show the users username. I did everything from backend to front. 

This is no where near as good as other programmers out there with way more experience. I just wanted to add this to my portfolio to show what I can do at this stage. 

I am still working on the cart portion of this app as well.
